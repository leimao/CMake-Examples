## Introduction

This repository contains several useful CMake examples I collected for CMake noobs including me. Instead of reading lengthy CMake documentations or randomly Googling, these examples are good start to write CMake files for your own projects.


## Recommended Tools

To better program using CMake, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code and install the following plugins.

* C/C++
* C++ Intellisense
* CMake
* CMake Tools

The following plugins are optional but also recommended in some cases.

* vscode-cudacpp
* vscode-icons
